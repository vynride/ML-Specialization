## Categories of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**
2. **Unsupervised Learning**
3. **Recommender Systems**
4. **Reinforcement Learning**

## 1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training an algorithm on a labeled dataset, which means the data includes both input (**X**) and output (**Y**) values.

- The goal is to learn the **mapping function** from **X → Y**
- The algorithm learns from the "right answers" during training.

### Regression

- Used when the **output (Y)** is a **continuous number** (from infinitely many possibilities).
- **Example**: Predicting house prices.

### Classification

- Used when the **output (Y)** is **categorical** (from a small set of categories).
- **Examples**:
  - Breast cancer detection (malignant vs. benign)
  - Identifying whether a photo contains a **cat** or a **dog**

> **Inputs are called**: **Features**

## 2. Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning, the data only contains inputs (**X**) and **no corresponding output labels (Y)**.

- The algorithm must discover patterns, structures, or relationships in the data **on its own**.

### Clustering

- A method where the algorithm **groups similar examples** together.
- Often used to find natural groupings in the data.

### Examples of Unsupervised Learning:

- Grouping news articles (e.g., Google News)
- DNA microarray data analysis
- Customer segmentation for marketing
- Anomaly detection
- Dimensionality reduction

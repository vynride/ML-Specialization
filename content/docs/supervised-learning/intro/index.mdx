## 🧑‍🏫 1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training an algorithm on a labeled dataset, which means the data includes both input (**X**) and output (**Y**) values.

- The goal is to learn the **mapping function** from **X → Y**
- The algorithm learns from the "right answers" during training.

### 🔢 Regression

- Used when the **output (Y)** is a **continuous number** (from infinitely many possibilities).
- **Example**: Predicting house prices.

### 🧾 Classification

- Used when the **output (Y)** is **categorical** (from a small set of categories).
- **Examples**:
  - Breast cancer detection (malignant vs. benign)
  - Identifying whether a photo contains a **cat** or a **dog**

> 📌 **Inputs are called**: **Features**

## 🧩 2. Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning, the data only contains inputs (**X**) and **no corresponding output labels (Y)**.

- The algorithm must discover patterns, structures, or relationships in the data **on its own**.

### 👥 Clustering

- A method where the algorithm **groups similar examples** together.
- Often used to find natural groupings in the data.

### 🧠 Examples of Unsupervised Learning:

- 📰 Grouping news articles (e.g., Google News)
- 🧬 DNA microarray data analysis
- 🛍️ Customer segmentation for marketing
- 🚨 Anomaly detection
- 📉 Dimensionality reduction
